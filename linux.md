# Linux

## Overview
Linux is an open-source operating system modeled on UNIX. It is widely used for servers, desktops, and embedded systems due to its flexibility, security, and robustness.

## Who
- **Linus Torvalds**: A Finnish software engineer who initiated the development of the Linux kernel in 1991. His vision was to create a free and open alternative to the MINIX operating system.

## What
Linux serves as the core operating system that manages hardware resources and provides essential services for software applications. Key features include:
- **Kernel**: The central component of Linux that interacts with hardware and manages system resources.
- **Distributions**: Variants of Linux that bundle the kernel with other software, libraries, and a user interface (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS).
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Many Linux distributions offer a powerful CLI for performing administrative tasks and scripting.

## Why
Linux is essential in various environments for several reasons:
- **Open Source**: Being open-source means anyone can view, modify, and distribute the source code, fostering community collaboration.
- **Stability and Security**: Linux is known for its reliability and security features, making it a popular choice for servers and enterprise environments.
- **Flexibility**: It can be customized for specific use cases, from lightweight distributions for old hardware to robust systems for cloud computing.

## When
- **1991**: Linus Torvalds releases the first version of the Linux kernel (0.01) to the public.
- **1992**: Linux becomes fully open-source, allowing users to modify and redistribute the source code.
- **1996**: The Linux kernel reaches version 2.0, supporting multiple processors and improving performance.
- **2000s**: Linux gains popularity in server environments, powering a significant portion of the internet.
- **2020s**: Linux continues to dominate in server, cloud, and embedded systems, with a growing presence in desktop computing.

## How
Linux operates using a modular architecture, where the kernel interacts with hardware and user space applications:
- **File System**: Linux uses a hierarchical file system structure, where everything is treated as a file (e.g., directories, devices).
- **Processes**: Linux manages multiple processes efficiently, allowing users to run various applications simultaneously.
- **Package Management**: Most distributions include package managers (e.g., APT, YUM) for installing, updating, and removing software.

### Example
Hereâ€™s how to perform a few basic tasks in a Linux terminal:

1. **Check System Information**:
   ```bash
   uname -a
