## Introduction
The internet has radically transformed communication, information sharing, and many aspects of everyday life. This document outlines the history and significance of key technologies that have shaped the digital landscape.

## The Internet

### Overview
The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols.

### Who
Key figures include Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, who developed the TCP/IP protocol suite that underpins internet communication.

### What
The internet is a vast system that enables data exchange across numerous devices, including computers, smartphones, and servers.

### Why
It facilitates instant communication, access to information, and services across the globe, revolutionizing multiple sectors such as education, commerce, and entertainment.

### When
The origins of the internet date back to the 1960s, but it became publicly accessible in the early 1990s with the advent of the World Wide Web.

### How
The internet operates on a decentralized model, using various hardware (servers, routers) and software (protocols, applications) to enable data transmission.

## Linux

### Overview
Linux is an open-source operating system widely used for servers, desktops, and embedded systems.

### Who
Linus Torvalds initiated the development of the Linux kernel in 1991.

### What
Linux is a Unix-like operating system that allows users to modify and distribute the source code freely.

### Why
It promotes community collaboration, security, and flexibility, making it popular among developers and enterprises.

### When
The first version of Linux was released on September 17, 1991.

### How
Linux is collaboratively developed by a global community and follows a modular architecture, allowing users to customize their installations.

## HTML

### Overview
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages.

### Who
Tim Berners-Lee proposed HTML as part of his invention of the World Wide Web in 1991.

### What
HTML structures content on the web, utilizing elements and tags to format text, images, and links.

### Why
It enables the creation of rich, interactive web pages and serves as the backbone of web development.

### When
HTML was first introduced in 1993, with several versions and updates released over the years.

### How
HTML uses nested elements and attributes to define the structure and content of a webpage.

## CSS

### Overview
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation of web pages.

### Who
HÃ¥kon Wium Lie and Bert Bos developed CSS in 1996.

### What
CSS allows developers to apply styles, such as colors and fonts, to HTML elements.

## Git

### Overview
Git is a distributed version control system that facilitates collaboration among developers.

### Who
Linus Torvalds developed Git in 2005 to manage Linux kernel development.

### What
Git tracks changes in source code, allowing multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously.

### Why
It ensures code integrity and facilitates collaboration, making it essential for modern software development.

### When
Git was first released on April 7, 2005.

### How
Git uses a branching model, allowing developers to work independently on features before merging changes into the main codebase.

## Search Engines

### Overview
Search engines index and retrieve information from the web based on user queries.

### Who
Alan E. Hall created the first search engine, Archie, in 1990, followed by others like Google.

### What
Search engines scan the web, index content, and use algorithms to return relevant results.

### Why
They help users find information quickly and easily in the vast sea of online content.

### When
