# HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

## Overview
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. It provides the basic structure of web pages, which is enhanced and modified by technologies like CSS and JavaScript.

## Who
- **Tim Berners-Lee**: Inventor of the World Wide Web, he proposed HTML in 1989 as part of his vision for a system to share information globally.

## What
HTML is used to structure content on the web, including:
- **Text**: Formatting headings, paragraphs, lists, and other textual elements.
- **Links**: Creating hyperlinks that connect to other web pages or resources.
- **Images and Multimedia**: Embedding images, audio, and video into web pages.
- **Forms**: Collecting user input through various form elements.

## Why
HTML is crucial for web development for several reasons:
- **Foundation of Web Pages**: It provides the essential structure for all web content.
- **Accessibility**: HTML elements help screen readers and other assistive technologies interpret content, making the web more accessible.
- **Interoperability**: HTML is supported by all web browsers, ensuring that web pages are viewable across different platforms.

## When
- **1989**: Tim Berners-Lee proposes HTML as part of the World Wide Web project.
- **1991**: The first version of HTML is published, with basic elements for structuring web content.
- **1995**: HTML 2.0 is released, formalizing the standard and adding more features.
- **1997**: HTML 4.0 is published, introducing support for multimedia and better accessibility features.
- **2014**: HTML5 becomes a W3C Recommendation, adding new features like native audio and video support, semantic elements, and improved APIs.

## How
HTML uses a series of elements and tags to define the structure and content of web pages:
- **Tags**: Enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<a>`), these define the start and end of elements.
- **Attributes**: Provide additional information about elements (e.g., `href` for links, `src` for images).
- **Document Structure**: An HTML document is structured with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.

### Example
Hereâ€™s a simple HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a simple paragraph of text.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
</body>
</html>
